# 🐥FlexDuck🐤
 Hackathon project within a team of two software developers.  Flexduck was created to teach new front-end developers how to utilize
 the css layout model, flexbox. Flexduck will teach you the
 flexbox directions, justify content, and align items.  Paired programming, github repos, and strong communication were used to implement this project between two 
 developers who had not previously known each other.
